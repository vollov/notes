Before you can start working locally on a remote branch, you need to fetch it as called out in answers below.

To fetch a branch, you simply need to:

git fetch origin
This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in, giving you a local working copy:

git checkout -b mongo-angularjs origin/mongo-angularjs


[5] Show remote servers
$ git remote -v
