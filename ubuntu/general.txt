[2]users and groups
Command-line
To add a user you must use the sudo command (for an explanation of what that 
means, see the RootSudo page). Here are the commands:

To add a user. NOTE: do not use the useradd command.
$ sudo adduser <username>
To see the options for adding a user try the man command.
$ man adduser


Here is a useful example of the useradd command. Why use useradd? 
It gives a few more options for special cases. To add a user, give her a 
standard home directory in the /home folder and specify the shell 
she accesses by default do this:

$ sudo useradd username -m -s /bin/bash 
$ sudo passwd username 

Groups
You might also wish to create a new group for your users.

# sudo addgroup <groupname>
To add a new user to a existing group you would do this:

# sudo adduser <username> audio
To add an existing user to an existing group you can use the same command:

# sudo adduser <username> <groupname>
or
# sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>
